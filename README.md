# Heart Failure Prediction

## Introduction and Objective

An estimated 17.9 million people died from Cardiovascular diseases CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke.
Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol.
It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin. 
Machine Learning algorithms can be applied in healthcare to adress these challenges and improve people lives.

## Used Data

To build this model and app, a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) was used. What is special about this dataset?
It uses data already published in clinical and scientific magazines, thus, peer reviewed and compliant with ethical data methodology.
